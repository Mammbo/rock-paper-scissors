// okay so the logic goes as follow 
// 1. blank screeen telling the user to pick a weapon 

// once their choice is clicked which needs to be listend to by a click enviornment lister, the computer program will run and give the random choice.
// the choose weapon next needs to be changed via js based off of the result of the match (tie win loss) and the text below that needs to display the choices ex: paper(human) beats rock(computer)!
//2. while that happens a point needs to be added to the player score. 
//3. once either player or computer reaches 5 the game is over and a pop up will appear asking to play again at that point new css elements will need to be added and changed along with the html file so the modal can popup. once clicked the dom will be reset restarting the program.
